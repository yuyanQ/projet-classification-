# projet-classification
A classification project, but unfortunately my PC was stolen and I lost the presentation slides. 

I've successfully and easily classified the spam dataset. That means, this corpus doesn't have much value for classification learning since the accuracy is already high enough and there isn't much room for improvement.

Regarding the Brown corpus, I haven't reduced the number of classes. Instead, I think it would be better to group the data into three larger classes. This would allow for a more balanced distribution of data within each class, and potentially improve the accuracy of the classification model.
